          <p>Cookies are small pieces of text stored on your computer (not our site) that help us know which browser you’re using and where you’ve been on our site. Most cookies are “session cookies” which means they’re automatically deleted at the end of each session. A cookie itself does not have the ability to automatically collect personal information about you. A cookie can store certain information that identifies your computer to us so that you don’t have to re-enter information as frequently when you use our site.</p>

          <h4>Disclosure Policy</h4>

          <p>For your convenience, our site contains links to other websites of interest. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the linked sites.</p>

          <p>We have security measures in place on our site to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We store and encrypt all user information on our server; however, we cannot guarantee unauthorized access as there is no such thing as flawless internet security.</p>
